# red-black_tree-data-structure-algorithm


In this programming task, we will create a class
red-black binary search trees increased, in order to make
quickly rank of operations, and to find in O (1) the predecessor
successor, the maximum and minimum.


Creates a class that RN_ tree that implements tree operations
binary red-black, dynamic row operations and which handles pred references
and succ in order to determine in O (1) the predecessor and the successor of a node
given.
• One constructor takes an array of integers as an argument, and
construct a red-black tree by inserting nodes whose keys are the
whole of the table.
• find_node (i): returns a node of the tree whose key is i
• tree_inserer (i): Creates a node that has i as a key, and then inserts it into
the tree. If i is a node, it is inserted directly.
• delete (i): delete the element whose key is i.
• read_rang (i): returns the element of rank i of the tree
• determin_rang (i): returns the key of the element of rank i in the tree.
• minimum, maximum: instance variables that store nodes of which
the keys are the minimum and the maximum.
• add_pred_succ (Node: x): function that restores the pred and
success after inserting x into the tree.
• delete_pred_suc (node: z): function that restores the properties
pred and success after removing z from the tree.
• inserere_correction_rn: see algorithm in the book
• delete_correction_rn: see algorithm in the book
• transplante_rn: see algorithm in the book
• rotation_gauche: see algorithm in the book
• rotate_right: see algorithm in the book
• minimum tree (x): see algorithm in the book
• poster: displays the nodes of the tree.
